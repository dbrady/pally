Feature Ideas from Ben:

- List current stories, tasks and defects in my current iteration
- Add tasks
- promote tasks (dbrady 2009-03-04: ?? I assume this means promote
  them  D->P->C->A ?)
- Add time to tasks
- Add comments to tasks
- Add defect to current iteration and assign time spent on it
- Edit comments and descriptions in an external editor


Feature Ideas from Dave:

- Interactive mode (like irb)
- Show a task/iteration/project/workspace
- Searth for task/iter/etc by id
- List iterations
- Change default current iteration/project
- Add a new story to the backlog
- Change owner of a task
- Search for tasks
  - by name
  - by id
  - by content
  - by submitter
  - by currently-working-on
- Delete tasks/stories/comments

- Commitment report showing hourly commitment from each user. E.g. At
  the beginning of each sprint we throw N hours of tasks into the
  hopper, then we try to divvy them out to various users. This report
  would show hours grouped by user, and the tasks remaining to be
  assigned. (Then you could use the "Change owner of a task"
  feature....)

- Pair shadowing. This is more of a mashup than anything else, but
  find a way to track pairing hours in Rally, even if it's by a
  tortuous accounting process, and then have Pally handle all the
  tortuous bits. There's various ways to do it, like creating a
  "Pairing" task or shadowing stories with pair stories. All I'm
  saying here is I'd want Pally to do it.
