Pally - Your friendly helpful Command-Line Interface to Rally
----------------------------------------------------------------------


So, it's a total hash right now, all it does is list iterations by
name. But the idea's the main thing, right?

= Setup =

Create pally.yml. You can put it in config, like a rails app, or you
can put it at ~/.pally/pally.yml (less chance you'll give it to someone on a USB
stick later).


= Operation =

 cd bin
 ./pally list iteration

That's it, that's all, that's everything. That's all it does so far.
